            "body": "ChatGPT is an artificial intelligence chatbot developed by OpenAI and launched in November 2022. It is built on top of OpenAI's GPT-3 family of large language models and has been fine-tuned (an approach to transfer learning) using both supervised and reinforcement learning techniques. ChatGPT was launched as a prototype on November 30,2022,and quickly garnered attention for its detailed responses and articulate answers across many domains of knowledge.Its uneven factual accuracy,however, has been identified as a significant drawback.Following the release of ChatGPT, OpenAI 's valuation was estimated at US$29 billion in 2023.\n\n\n Although the core function of a chatbot is to mimic a human conversationalist, ChatGPT is versatile.For example, it can write and debug computer programs,compose music, teleplays,fairy tales, and student essays;answer test questions(sometimes, depending on the test, at a level above the average human test - taker);write poetry and song lyrics;emulate a Linux system;simulate an entire chat room;play games like tic - tac - toe;and simulate an ATM.ChatGPT 's training data includes man pages and information about Internet phenomena and programming languages, such as bulletin board systems and the Python programming language.",

            "body": "Introduction to ReactJS: Let us understand this with a practical example.\n\nLet’s say one of your friends posted a photograph on Facebook. Now you go and like the image and then you started checking out the comments too. Now while you are browsing over comments you see that the likes count has increased by 100, since you liked the picture, even without reloading the page. This magical count change is because of Reactjs. \nReact is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It’s ‘V’ in MVC. ReactJS is an open-source, component-based front end library responsible only for the view layer of the application. It is maintained by Facebook.\nReact uses a declarative paradigm that makes it easier to reason about your application and aims to be both efficient and flexible. It designs simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right component when your data changes. The declarative view makes your code more predictable and easier to debug.\nA React application is made of multiple components, each responsible for rendering a small, reusable piece of HTML. Components can be nested within other components to allow complex applications to be built out of simple building blocks. A component may also maintain an internal state – for example, a TabList component may store a variable corresponding to the currently open tab.\n\nNote: React is not a framework. It is just a library developed by Facebook to solve some problems that we were facing earlier.\nPrerequisites: Download Node packages with their latest version.\n\nExample: Create a new React project by using the command below:\n\nnpx create-react-app myapp",
